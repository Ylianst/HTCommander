If you setup HT Commander with a callsign and allow transmit you can request weather reports for a location and time. Connect to the radio and in the [APRS tab](https://github.com/Ylianst/HTCommander/blob/main/docs/APRS.md), there is a menu on the upper right where you can click "Weather Report...". Then enter the location and select a time and report type. You can get extra information on this service at [WxBot](https://sites.google.com/site/ki6wjp/wxbot).
