Handi-Talky Commander has support for the AGWPE protocol, which is a popular protocol used in the amateur radio community to connect applications that use packet radio with a radio.

To activate this feature, go the "File" -> "Settings" menu, "Services" tab and "Enable AGWPE Server". You will generally keep the default port of 8000.

Then, you can run your own packet application and connect it to port 8000. You will see a "Port1: Handi-Talky Commander" port available in your application. Sending on this port will send data on the VFO1 of the radio.

You can try the following applications that are available on [this page](https://uz7.ho.ua/packetradio.htm).
