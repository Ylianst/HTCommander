# Packet Capture

Handi-Talky Commander has a built-in packet capture feature which is great if you are a developer or want to simply have a tool to decode packet radio data and see every bit. The packet capture tab will automatically show all of the data sent and received and try to decode this data the best it can. Raw packets are decoded into AX.25 and is it works, APRS decoding may also be attempted.

You can click on a packet to see the decoding and can also select a range of packets to save into a seperate file. You can also hit the 3 lines menu at the upper right and load up a packet capture file which will open in a seperate window.

Packets are saves in a basic CSV format, so, each to read with other tools and applications.
