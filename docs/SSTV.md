Handi-Talky Commander has built-in support to transmit and receive SSTV with a wide range of supported formats including Robot36.

On the receive side, incoming SSTV transmissions are automatically detected and will show up on the "Communication" tab as the image is received. Once received, double click on the image to have a larger view of it.

To transmit an image you can drag & drop a PNG, JPEG, BMP into the "Communication" tab or go in the communication tab and select "Image..." from the context menu on the bottom right to select an image. Once an image is selected, you will see a dialog box that will confirm what image will be trasmitted and allows you to select what protocol you want to use.

Note that is seems the radio has a transmit limit of 60 seconds and so, image formats that take longer than 60 seconds will fail to fully transmit. Not sure if this limit can be fixed or not so, the safe bet is to use Robot36.
