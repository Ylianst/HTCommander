Handi-Talky Commander has built-in support for WinLink. You can send and receive emails when contacting any packet radio email gateways. Then checking or sending emails, the radio with switch to the frequency of the Winlink gateway, sync-up and return back when it's done. You can compose and read emails within the application and add, save or drag & drop attachements making authoring easy.

To use this feature, you will need to setup your Winlink account on [Winlink.org](https://winlink.org) and find your nearest gateway. You will also need to enter your Winlink password in the Handi-Talky Commander settings panel to correctly authenticate.
