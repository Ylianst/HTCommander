If you setup HT Commander with a callsign and allow transmit you can send SMS messages to normal mobile phones using APRS. Before doing this, you must have the recipient of the SMS message opt-in for this service. Go to [aprs.wiki](https://aprs.wiki/) and opt in. The service will send an SMS message to the phone and you will need to confirm with a SMS reply.

Once opted-in, connect HT Commander to the radio and in the [APRS tab](https://github.com/Ylianst/HTCommander/blob/main/docs/APRS.md), there is a menu on the upper right where you can click "SMS Message...". Once there, enter the phone number and message. Note that both the phone number and message will be sent without any encryption or authentication.
