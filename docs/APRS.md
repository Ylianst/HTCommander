The main tab in Handi-Talky Commander is the APRS tab. You can use this tab to see messages from others, send you own message and see a lot of telemetry messages. In general, if you set your radio right, the radio will always monitor the APRS channel even if you doing normal voice monitoring on a different non-APRS channel. So, don't be surprised if you set the radio to your favorite repeater and still see APRS messages coming in. When you send a APRS message out, we tell the radio this is a APRS packet and so, it should be transmitted on the correct frequency.

On the upper right, you can click on the 3 bars to opt to not see telemetry messages. You can also send SMS message to normal phones which is great if you need to send a text message and don't have cell phone access.

In the "File" -> "Settings" -> "APRS" dialog box, you can add more APRS routes. Once you have more than one route configured, a drop-down box will show up on the upper right of the APRS tab and you can select what route you want to use when sending messages. This allows you messages to hit the digipeaters you want to get your message to the right destination.

APRS telemetry messages will show up on the [map tab](https://github.com/Ylianst/HTCommander/blob/main/docs/Map.md), and you can right click on any APRS message to get details to show a mini-map of the location of the station.
