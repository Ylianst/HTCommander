# Programming Channels

In the "Settings" menu you can import and export channels. When exporting, all currently displayed channels are saved in a CSV file with the Chirp format, or the format compatible with the application for this radio.

When importing channel, a new window will show up with the imported channels and you can drag & drop the channels to put them in the position you like.

At any time, you can also drag and drop channels in the radio itself to reposition them as you want. Makes it all very easy to control how you want your channels setup.
