# Address Book

Handi-Talky Commander has a built-in address book. This is currently useful to keep a list of [APRS](https://github.com/Ylianst/HTCommander/blob/main/docs/APRS.md) stations you quickly want to select, or [terminal](https://github.com/Ylianst/HTCommander/blob/main/docs/Terminal.md) profiles you want to use. In the future, more could be done with this but it seems like a basic feature to make everything else in the application work better.
