# Terminal

Like the older days of modems and BBS's, Handi-Talky Commander has a built-in Terminal allowing you to directly send and receive data to another endoint. This is super useful if you want to chat directly with other people or want to connect to a remote BBS. The terminal feature is only available to users to have a HAM radio license and send allow this application to transmit on the radio, otherwise, the terminal option is hidden.

To get started, just go on the terminal tab and hit connect on the upper right to add a new connection profile or connect to an existing one. You will need to specify the remote station and the type of protocol to use. Currently, only RAW AX.25 frames and APRS frames are supported. You will also select on what channel to connect to. Once the profile is created, the radio will automatically be set to the right channel and "locked" to that channel until you disconnect the terminal or you change the channel on the radio itself.

You should NOT use the terminal on the APRS channel. This is built to be used on other channels, however while using the terminal, the radio can monitor the APRS channel and still display incoming APRS messages. You can also send APRS messages while the terminal is connected and the main channel is locked.

If this something that is much better than the normal KISS protocol as this application can monitor and transmit on both APRS and Terminal channels and not be confused to as to which channel is which.
