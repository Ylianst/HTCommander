Starting with radio firmware 0.8.5, HT Commander can read the state of the radio's internal GPS. If you have this firmware version, HT Commander will display the GPS state like "GPS Lock" on the radio. You can click on this state or go in the About menu to get details on the GPS including latitude and longitude. In the APRS map, you will see your current position with a blue position pin and there will be a button of the upper right to center the map on your GPS coordinates.
