Handi-Talky Commander has as built-in support for Open Street Map and will show stations sending APRS telemetry on the map. Obviously, you will need internet access to load this map. You can zoom in/out and move around and click on stations to see their callsigns.

This application does not access the Internet at all, except to load the Open Street Map data. So, no hidden telemetry. This is in contracts to the official application for this radio that does send usage data back to China.

Also, in the [APRS tab](https://github.com/Ylianst/HTCommander/blob/main/docs/APRS.md), you can right click on a station that sent coordinates and opt to see the location on a mini-map.
