# Map

Handi-Talky Commander has as built-in support for Open Street Map and will show stations sending APRS telemetry on the map. Obviously, you will need internet access to load this map. You can zoom in/out and move around and click on stations to see their callsigns. You can right-click and drag to select a area of the map and go in the map menu to cache that area to disk. Once cached, you can switch the map into offline mode and no requests will be made to the Open Street Map servers. This is useful if you want to use the map without an internet connection, for example, when you are out in the field.

This application does not access the Internet at all, except to load the Open Street Map data. So, no hidden telemetry. This is in contrast to the official application for this radio that does send usage data back to China.

Also, in the [APRS tab](https://github.com/Ylianst/HTCommander/blob/main/docs/APRS.md), you can right click on a station that sent coordinates and opt to see the location on a mini-map.
