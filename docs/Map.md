# Map

Handi-Talky Commander has as built-in support for Open Street Map and will show stations sending APRS telemetry on the map. Obviously, you will need internet access to load this map. You can zoom in/out amd move around and click on stations to see their callsigns.

Also, in the APRS tab, you can right click on a station that sent coordinates and opt to see the location on a mini-map.
