As of version 0.43, in the "Audio" menu there is a new "Audio Clips" menu item. This feature allows you to record and save short voice clips that you can play back later. This is useful if you want to playback you callsign on demand or have pre-recorded messages for specific situations like checking into a local NET.

You can record a clip, name it what you want, adjust the audio level, play it locally and when ready, transmit it.
