# Handi-Talky Commander

This is a Amateur Radio (HAM Radio) tool for the UV-Pro, GA-5WB, VR-N76, VR-N7500 radios that works on Windows that have support for Bluetooth LE. It allows for easy control over the radio over Bluetooth and doing APRS messaging. This is an early preview version with the goal for it to support BBS's, WinLink and more.

### Radio Support

The following radios should work with this application:

- BTech UV-Pro
- RadioOddity GA-5WB (untested)
- Vero VR-N76 (untested)
- Vero VR-N7500 (untested)

### Installation

There are no installers, just [download the zip file](releases/htcommander-0.1.zip), extract and run.

### Credits

This tool is based on the decoding work done by [Kyle Husmann](https://github.com/khusmann) and his BenLink project which decoded the Bluetooth commands for these radios. Also [APRS-Parser](https://github.com/k0qed/aprs-parser) by Lee, K0QED.
